## Introduction to Cloud

Cloud in simple term, is just a set of tool that help you as a developer spend less time managing and more time creating.

## Introduction to GCP

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a collection of cloud computing services that are offered by Google. These services include computing power, storage, and databases, as well as networking, security, and management and monitoring tools. With GCP, you can build and run applications, store and analyze data, and create virtual machines and containers.

## Creating a GCP Project

Before you can start using GCP services, you need to create a GCP project. A project is a container for all the resources you create in GCP. It is used to organize and manage resources, and to control access to them. To create a new project, you can use the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

## GCP Compute Services

GCP offers a variety of compute services that you can use to run your applications.

### Compute Engine

[Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) is a service that allows you to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on GCP. With Compute Engine, you can choose from a variety of machine types, operating systems, and disk types, and you can scale your VMs up or down as needed.

### Kubernetes Engine

[Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) is a service that allows you to run and manage containers on GCP. With Kubernetes Engine, you can create and manage clusters of containerized applications, and you can scale your clusters up or down as needed.

## GCP Storage and Databases

GCP offers a variety of storage and database services
